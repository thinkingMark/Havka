    The uzvar is a national Ukrainian beverage, cooked with dried fruits and berries.Some housewives tend to add species – star anise or nutmeg – that will give the drink an exotic flavor.
    The main ingredients of uzvar are dried apples, pears, plums and raisins; sometimes fresh raspberries, blueberries or strawberries might be added. Nevertheless the protagonist and reason of inimitable flavor and fragrance is honey. It substitutes sugar. The uzvar could be consumed both hot and cooled; however it is traditionally served cool.
