    Fried Eastern Slavic pancakes, garnished with sour cream, varenye, jam, honey or apple sauce. The cheese mixture may contain raisins for extra flavour.
    They are a part of Belarusian, Russian,  Ukrainian, Latvian. Their simplicity and delicious taste have made them very popular in Eastern Europe.
    The name sirniki is derived from the word syr, which now generally means "(yellow) cheese" in Russian, but once partly stood for soft white cheese. The Ukrainian language retains the old Slavic sense of the word, as in domashnii syr, whereas in Russian, the word for white cheese is tvorog (творог).
